>> Scott Moss: And I have a schema cheat sheet here that you can look at that's got a lot more stuff when it comes to GraphQL Schema and stuff. So it's a really good cheat sheet. Shows you pretty much every single thing you need when it comes to creating a GraphQL using the SDL, the schema definition language.

I talked about those scholars and other stuff. There's lots that we didn't talk about that we'll be getting to. But it's a really good reference to understanding how to create schemas and the different parts inside the schemas that exist in GraphQL. That link is in the slides. Really good, I highly recommend having this pulled up as you start going through this next exercise cuz it will definitely help you.
