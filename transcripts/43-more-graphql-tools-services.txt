[00:00:00]
>> Scott Moss: So some of the other cool stuff I wanted to talk about, definitely gotta give a shout out to some of my favorite tools. Prisma, highly recommend checking them out. So if you've ever heard of a company called Graphcool, they pivoted to this. Basically what they do is if you give them a database, they will create a GraphQL server for you, with TypeScript bindings and everything.

[00:00:23]
I mean, they basically create you a GraphQL server. It's pretty legit, so I highly recommend checking them out. They're adding new different databases all the time. Yeah, it's basically trying to replace ORMs, like Mongoose, so you can just query everything with GraphQL instead. So it's pretty cool. I've used it before, it's a really nice product.

[00:00:42]
So that one's good. Another one is Hasura, which is very similar to Prisma. Yeah, it's very similar to Prisma, as in you give them a Postgres database, and they just spin up a RESTful GraphQL API, complete with searching, and filtering, and querying, and everything. They'll even deploy it for you.

[00:01:01]
And it has realtime as well, so they have sockets. This one's really cool, too. I know the founders of both of these companies, they're really, really good people. This one's also open source, for sure. I think Prisma is also open source as well. So they're both really good to contribute to, both really good teams.

[00:01:20]
Another product that's really cool is GraphQL-Anywhere.
>> Scott Moss: It got moved to the public client. I see, okay, yeah. So basically, GraphQL-Anywhere basically allows you to run GraphQL anywhere. So you can just run GraphQL literally anywhere you wanna run it. I run it on a client sometimes to do, like I keep saying, making CSS, querying a DOM.

[00:01:45]
You can do whatever you want because you can run it anywhere. You don't need a database or anything like that. You could literally run GraphQL against anything anywhere. Is it a good idea to do that? No, probably not. But it basically allows you to tie into GraphQL's query language to resolve whatever you want, right?

[00:02:02]
You can resolve, like I said, there's querying a DOM, you can resolve to spitting out SAS, you can resolve to making animations. I wouldn't be surprised if I googled GraphQL animations, they would be a thing.
>> Scott Moss: Maybe not, maybe somebody needs you to make that. [LAUGH]
>> Speaker 2: Not yet.

[00:02:21]

>> Scott Moss: Yeah, not yet, they're not there yet. But yeah, so GraphQL allows you to do that, or GraphQL-Anywhere allows you to do that. Other cool stuff is,
>> Scott Moss: GraphQL CLI.
>> Scott Moss: Which is exactly what it sounds like, it's a CLI for GraphQL. And it just helps you get started, create schemas, launches that playground that we used today.

[00:02:48]
All types of GraphQL-related things. So check it out, it's really cool. And then the last thing is,
>> Scott Moss: That's it. I already showed you GraphQL playground. Yeah, that's the only cool stuff I can think of.
>> Speaker 2: The last thing is Tipe.
>> Scott Moss: Yeah, yeah, so yeah.
>> Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

[00:03:09]

>> Scott Moss: Yeah, my company. Yeah, so Tipe, basically, I've been working on Tipe for about a year, me and my two cofounders. And basically what we're doing is we're trying to be the next content management system out there. So you've got the WordPresses of the world. What we're doing is we'll allow you to create a schema file, whether it's in GraphQL, TypeScript, JavaScript, doesn't matter.

[00:03:29]
You create a file on your project, you send one command with a CLI up to us, and we generate a dashboard, a API, and a schema. And basically what we do is we allow you to give that dashboard to your non-technical people on your team so they can manage content on their own.

[00:03:43]
So they can change images, links, copy, anything that's content on your website, or any app that you have. They can change it with a generated dashboard that's based on the rules, and types, and schemas that you created. And then that's it, and then they can change it on the fly, you integrate it once, and you're done.

[00:04:00]
So that's basically what we do. So we're pushing for that, we're releasing our next version really soon. You can watch the video if you'd like to. Sign up for beta, just put your email address in there and sign up. We've got a long list. And, yeah, we use GraphQL, we also use REST.

[00:04:16]
We also do a whole bunch of other crazy stuff. So yeah, that's Tipe.
>> Speaker 2: Okay.
>> Scott Moss: All right.
>> Speaker 2: Thank you.
>> Scott Moss: Thank you.
>> Speaker 2: [APPLAUSE]
